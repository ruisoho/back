# UNDERCODE ROADMAP

The project should span for about 4 weeks at most with substantial features to produce a working application. We'll be looking to the SPA (Single Page Application) route for now except there are any cause for a MPA. 

The application should and will be available offline. So we'll implement the PWA features to make it offline first. 

	•	Mockups
	•	Landing Page
	•	Creating other sections (components)
	•	Re-rendering and merging sections 
	•	Contact field/feature
	•	Making changes where it's needed
	•	Testing 
	•	User testing (initial deploy)
	•	Working with feedback (enhancing application)
	•	Final deploy

FEATURES:
The application is basically for the developer and designer class. We want to be able to provide free up to date resources to aspiring or intermediate users. Sections of the application will include:
	•	Community section 
	•	Q&A
	•	User profile
	•	Landing
	•	Resource center
	•	News and updates center (on technologies)
	•	What stack an application submitted is built on
	•	Ability for users to submit their projects and get listed for daily or monthly shoutouts 
	•	Verification process for genuine user resource submission (this will be in the advanced version of the application)

STACK TO BE USED:
MERN

Bonus:
HTML & CSS knowledge
Design knowledge (UI/UX)

AI (is a plus)
